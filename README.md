# True or false game
This is my learning project on how to write a "true or false" game. In this work, the key challenge for me was to get the architecture of the project right.

## About the code
The code is unprotected against incorrect entry of values. This is done on purpose, as this was not the main task. 

There are only 5 questions in the main question file `Question.csv`.
You can add new ones there, but keep the `question;answer;explanation` structure of the file.
